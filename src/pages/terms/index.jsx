              These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the TEK-UP Digital
              Credentials platform (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be
              bound by these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
            <p>
              The Service enables users to create profiles, request validation of competencies, and
              receive verifiable digital certifications recorded on blockchain and stored via IPFS.
              Certifiers can assess skills and issue credentials. Recruiters may view and verify
              credentials shared by users.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>
              You must be legally capable of entering into a binding agreement and comply with
              applicable laws. Institutional or certifier access may require additional verification.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Wallets & Authentication</h2>
            <p>
              The Service supports wallet-based authentication (e.g., MetaMask). You are responsible
              for securing your wallet, seed phrase, and devices. We do not store private keys and
              cannot recover them for you.
            </p>

            <h2>4. On-chain Data & Immutability</h2>
            <p>
              Certifications and related metadata may be written to public or consortium blockchains.
              Such records are typically immutable. Please verify information before submitting; errors
              may not be reversible.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Content & Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for the accuracy of information you submit. Certifiers are
              responsible for the assessments they perform and credentials they issue.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              We process personal data in accordance with applicable laws. Certain credential data may
              be publicly verifiable to fulfill the Serviceâ€™s purpose. Refer to our Privacy Policy for
